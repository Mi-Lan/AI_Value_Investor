# 🔒 Security Guide - Protecting Your TIKR Credentials

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Your Credentials Were Exposed!**

I found hardcoded credentials in your `config.py` file. **These have been removed** for your security.

---

## 🛡️ **Secure Credential Management**

### ✅ **Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended for Local)**

1. **Create a `.env` file** (copy from `env_example.txt`):
   ```bash
   cp env_example.txt .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` with your real credentials:**
   ```bash
   TIKR_EMAIL=your_actual_email@example.com
   TIKR_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
   ```

3. **The `.env` file is automatically ignored by Git** (never committed)

### ✅ **Option 2: User Input (Recommended for Deployment)**

The web app prompts users to enter their own credentials:
- Credentials are entered in the sidebar
- Each user uses their own TIKR account
- Nothing is stored permanently

### ✅ **Option 3: Streamlit Secrets (For Cloud Deployment)**

When deploying to Streamlit Cloud:

1. **Go to your app dashboard**
2. **Click "Settings" → "Secrets"**
3. **Add your credentials:**
   ```toml
   TIKR_EMAIL = "your_email@example.com"
   TIKR_PASSWORD = "your_password"
   ```

## 🚨 **Deployment Security Recommendations**

### 🌟 **For Streamlit Cloud (Public Apps):**

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**
- ❌ **Don't** put your credentials in the deployed app
- ✅ **Let each user enter their own credentials**
- ✅ **Users get their own TIKR accounts (free trial available)**

**Why?** Because:
- Your friends need their own TIKR accounts anyway
- You avoid credential sharing/abuse
- Much more secure and scalable

### 🚂 **For Railway/Private Deployment:**

If you want to share YOUR credentials:
1. **Use environment variables in Railway dashboard**
2. **Never commit credentials to Git**
3. **Monitor usage** to avoid abuse

## 🔧 **What I've Done to Secure Your App:**

✅ **Removed hardcoded credentials** from `config.py`  
✅ **Added comprehensive `.gitignore`** to prevent future accidents  
✅ **Created `env_example.txt`** for local development  
✅ **Web app prompts users for their own credentials**  

---

## 🎯 **Deployment Recommendations by Use Case:**

### 👥 **Showing Friends (Demo):**
```
Approach: Let friends use their own credentials
Security: ✅ High - No credential sharing
Setup: ✅ Easy - They enter credentials in web UI
```

### 🏢 **Team/Company Use:**
```
Approach: Shared company TIKR account via environment variables
Security: ⚠️ Medium - Monitor access
Setup: 🔧 Medium - Requires credential management
```

### 🏠 **Personal Use Only:**
```
Approach: Your credentials in .env file
Security: ✅ High - Private deployment
Setup: ✅ Easy - Local or private hosting
```

## 🚀 **Safe Deployment Steps:**

1. **Check credentials are secure:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure these show placeholder values, not real credentials
   grep -r "TIKR_EMAIL" tikr_scraper/config.py
   ```

2. **Test locally with .env file:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env with your credentials
   echo "TIKR_EMAIL=your_email@example.com" > .env
   echo "TIKR_PASSWORD=your_password" >> .env
   python run_web_app.py
   ```

3. **Deploy safely:**
   ```bash
   # Credentials are NOT in the code
   python deploy.py
   ```

---

## 🆘 **If You Already Pushed Credentials to GitHub:**

1. **Change your TIKR password immediately**
2. **Remove the repository** if it's public
3. **Create a new repository** with the secured version
4. **Use Git history rewriting** if needed:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch tikr_scraper/config.py' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Users enter their own credentials  
- ✅ `.env` files are git-ignored
